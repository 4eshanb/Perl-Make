# Perl-Make
This project is a Perl program that is a replacement for a subset of gmake. Perl is powerful because it supports 
rapid development, there is no need to do compile-run cycle since the program is compiled every time it is run.
The pmake utility executes a list of commands from the shell associated with each target, typically to create or
update files of the same name. The Makefile contains entries that describe how to bring a target up to date.

This is a project for Professor Wesley Mackey's CMPS 112 at UCSC.
